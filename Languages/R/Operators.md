## Arithmetic Operators 
- [[Operators#Addition |Addition]] 
- [[Operators#Subtraction|Subtraction]]
- [[Operators#Multiplication|Multiplication]]
- [[Operators#Division|Division]] 
- [[Operators#Exponent |Exponent]]

### Order of Arithmetic Operators 
- Parenthesis 
- Exponent 
- Multiplication and division (left to right) 
- Add and subtraction (left to right)

### Examples
Using [[Variables and Data types |Variables]] with operators

#### Addition
```R
100 + 200
10 + 5
```

#### Subtraction
```R 
100 - 200
10 - 5
```

#### Multiplication 
```R
100 * 200
10 * 5
```

#### Division
```R
100 / 200
10 / 5
```

#### Exponent
```R
10^2
```

## Logical Operators
Returns a [[Variables and Data types#Logical |Logical Value]]

- Greater than (>) 
- Less than (<)
- Greater than or equal to (>=10)
- Less than or equal to (<=)
- Equal to ( == ) 
- Not equal to (!=)

```R
variable1 <operator> variable2
```
