## What is Data
Data refers to facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis.

### Types of Data
#### Qualitative Data
Qualitative Data deals with characteristics and descriptors that cant be easily measured but can be observed subjectively.

**Types of Qualitative Data**
*Nominal*
Data with no inherent order or ranking ex: Gender

*Ordinal*
Data with an ordered series ex: Rating

#### Quantitative Data
Quantitative data deals with numbers and things you can measure objectively

**Types of Quantitative Data**
*Discrete*
Data can hold a finite number of possible values ex: No of students in a class | you cant have 1.5 students in a classroom

*Continuous*
Data that can hold infinite number of possible values ex: Weight | your weight can be 1.5 or 1.0005

# Statistics
## What is Statistics 
Statistics is an area of applied mathematics concerned with the data collection, analysis, interpretation and presentation. 

---
### Basic Terminologies in Statistics
**Population**
A collection or set of individuals or objects or events whose properties are to be analysed 

**Sample**
A subset of population is called "Sample". A well chosen sample will contain most of the information about a particular population parameter

---
## Sampling
Sampling is a statistical method that deals with the selection of individual observations.

*Used to understand the different statistics of a population*
**Example**
- Mean 
- Median 
- Mode
- Standard Deviation
- Variance

### Sampling Techniques
#### Probability 
A sampling technique where samples from a large population are chosen by using the theory of probability 

**Random Sampling**
Each member of the population has an equal chance of being a part of the sample.

**Systematic Sampling**
Every nth record is chosen from the population to be a part of the sample

**Stratified Sampling**
A stratum is used to form samples
A stratum is a subset of the population that shares at least one common characteristic ex: Gender
Random Sampling is used to select a sufficient number of subjects from each stratum 

#### Non-probability 
- Snowball 
- Quota 
- Judgement 
- Convenience

### Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive Statistics uses the data to provide descriptions of the population, either through numerical calculations, graphs or tables.
- Maximum 
- Average 
- Minimum

#### Categories of Descriptive Statistics
***Measures of Central Tendency***
- ***Mean*** 
Average of all values in a sample

- ***Median*** 
Center value 

- ***Mode***
The value that is repeated the most

***Measures of Variability***
- ***Range***
Measure of how spread apart the values are

- ***Inter Quartile Range***
Quartiles tell us about the spread of a dataset by breaking the dataset into quarters, just like the median breaks it in half

- ***Variance***
Variance describes how much a random variable differs from its expected value. It entails computing squares of deviations

- ***Standard Deviation***
Deviation is the difference between each of the element from the mean

*Finding out standard deviation*
- Find out the mean
- Then for each number subtract the mean and square the result 
- Work out the mean of the differences
- Take the square root

### Inferential Statistics
Inferential Statistics makes inferences and predictions based on a sample data of the population. 

#### Point Estimation
Point estimation is concerned with the use of the sample data to measure a single value which serves as an approximate value or the best estimate of an unknown population parameter

**Finding Estimates**
	- *Method of moments*: Found by equating the first K sample moments to the corresponding k population moments 
- *Maximum of likelihood*: Uses a model and the values in the model to maximize a likelihood function 
- *Bayes Estimators* : Minimizes the error 
- *Best unbiased Estimators*: Unbiased estimators to approximate a parameter 

### Interval Estimate
An interval or range of values that are used to estimate a population parameter

### Confidence Interval
Confidence Interval is the measure of your confidence that the interval estimate contains the population mean

#### Margin of Error 
For a given level of confidence is the greatest possible distance between the point estimate and the value of the parameter it is missing

## Information gain and Entropy
### Entropy
Entropy measures the impurity or uncertainty present in the data

## Information gain
Information gain indicates how much information a particular feature/variable gives about the final outcome

## Bayes Theorem 
Shows the relation between one condition and its inverse.
