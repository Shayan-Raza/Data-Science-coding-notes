## What is Machine Learning 
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. It focuses mainly on the designing of systems, thereby allowing them to learn and make predictions based on some experience which is data in case of machines

## How does Machine Learning work
- Training Data 
- Training the ML algorithm 
- Model input data 
- New input data 
- ML Algorithm
- Prediction

## Types of Machine Learning 
- Supervised 
- Unsupervised 
- Reinforcement 

### [[Supervised learning]]
Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is a subcategory of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately.

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. Its ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it the ideal solution for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image recognition.

### Reinforcement learning
Reinforcement learning is an area of Machine Learning. It is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation. Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in a way that in supervised learning the training data has the answer key with it so the model is trained with the correct answer itself whereas in reinforcement learning, there is no answer but the reinforcement agent decides what to do to perform the given task. In the absence of a training dataset, it is bound to learn from its experience.

## AI vs ML vs Deep learning
### AI
A technique which enables machines to mimic human behavior

### Machine Learning
Subset of AI which use statistical methods to enable machines to improve with experience

### Deep learning
Subset of ML which make computation of multi later neutral network feasible

## Different type of Algorithms
### Classification Algorithm
> Category is predicted using the data

***Example***
Is the person male or female

### Anomaly Detection Algorithm
> Technique used to find an unusual pattern

***Example***
Is there any fraud in this transaction. 

### Clustering Algorithm
> Groups data based on some condition

***Example***
Which type of house lies in this segment

### Regression Algorithm
> Form of predictive modelling technique which investigates the relationship between a dependent and independent variable

***Example***
What is the market value of this house
