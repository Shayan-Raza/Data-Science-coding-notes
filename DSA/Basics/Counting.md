# Counting

## Multiplying
If an events happens in n different ways and a another event happens in m different ways the number of different ways both events can happen is 
n x m. 

***Example***
A Pin code has 2 numerical digits and a letter. 
Therefore there are 100 digits * 26 letters 
2600 seconds 
43min

## Permutations
If we have n items we can order them in n! (n factorial)
n! = n × (n − 1) × (n − 2) × · · · × 2 × 1
 n! is the number of ways n items can be ordered

***Example***
A truck delivers to 15 cities
If it takes a microsecond to calculate the length of one route 
How long does it take to compute the length of all routes

Each permutation of the 15 cities is a different route. The factorial
is the number of distinct permutations, so there are 15! = 15 ×
14 × · · · × 1 ≈ 1.3 trillion routes. That in microseconds is roughly
equivalent to 15 days.

## Combinations
Unlike in permutations, in combinations order doesn't matter.

***Example***
A deck with 13 cards with all spades.
How many ways can you deal six card to your opponent?
13! / (13 −6)! is the number of permutations of six out of 13 possible items.
But order doesn't matter
So we divide this by 6!
13! / 6!(13 − 6)!
= 1, 716 combinations.

## Sums
Calculating sums of sequences occurs often when counting. 
They are expressed using the  capital-sigma (Σ) notation.
