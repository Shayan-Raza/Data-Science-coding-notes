# Probability 
---
## Counting Outcomes
> P = # of ways the event can happen / # of possible outcomes

Works because each possible outcome is equally likely to happen. The object is balanced and it isn't biased.

## Independent events
When an outcome of an events does not influence the outcome of the other event its it called independent events.

---
## Mutually Exclusive events 
When 2 events cannot happen simultaneously they are mutually exclusive.

---
## Complementary events 
When two mutually exclusive events cover all possible outcomes, they are complementary. The sum of probabilities is thus 100%
