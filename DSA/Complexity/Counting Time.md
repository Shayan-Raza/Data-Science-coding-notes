# Counting Time

## Computational Complexity
Given some input data of size n, how long will a function take to run?
How does the number of computations scale with n?

## Runtime
- **BEST CASE:** when the input requires the minimum number of operations for any input of that size. In sorting, it happens when the input is already sorted.

- **WORST CASE:** when the input requires the maximum number of operations for any input of that size. In many sorting algorithms, thatâ€™s when the input was given in reverse order.

- **AVERAGE CASE:** refers to the average number of operations required for typical inputs of that size. For sorting, an input in random order is usually considered.

**The Worst Case scenario is used and is often referred to**
