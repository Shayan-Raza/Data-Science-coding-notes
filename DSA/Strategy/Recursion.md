# Recursion 
Recursion is a function that calls itself.
**Example**
```
funtion fib(n)
	if n < 2
		return 1
	return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

## Recursion vs [[Iteration]]
- Recursive Algorithms are simpler and shorter
- Recursive Algorithms take more computer resources
- Iterative code is faster but its also more complex and harder to understand
