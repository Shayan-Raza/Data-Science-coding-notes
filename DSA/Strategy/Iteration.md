# Iteration
- Each step in a loop is called an iteration.
- It is great for running through an input and applying the same operations on every part of it.

## Loops
### For Loop
In a for loop the number of iterations is already known and is used to obtain certain results.

**Example**
```
names = ["Shayan", "Raza"]

for name in names
	print(name)
```
This returns the elements in the list. The loop goes through the elements one by one and prints them. 

### While loop
The command runs until a certain condition is reached and the statement is proved to be false.

**Example**
```
i = 1 
while i < 6:
	print(i)
	i += 1
```
This returns the values 1 - 5. The loop stops at 6 as at that point the condition is no longer being met.
